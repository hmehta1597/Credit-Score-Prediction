# Credit-Score-Prediction


In the rapidly evolving financial landscape, credit score prediction remains a pivotal factor in determining the creditworthiness of individuals and enterprises. Traditional credit scoring systems often rely on historical financial data and linear statistical methods, which may not capture complex patterns and non-linear interactions in the data. This project explores the application of advanced machine learning (ML) models to enhance the accuracy and efficiency of credit score predictions. We compare several ML techniques, including logistic regression, decision trees, support vector machines, Naive Bayes, and KNN, using a dataset that encompasses a broad spectrum of demographic and financial attributes. 

**Data**


The dataset includes 150,000 records (Training Data: 100000 records and Test Data: 50000 records) and 28 variables, capturing a broad spectrum of financial and personal information. We conducted extensive data cleaning and preprocessing to handle null values, outliers, and ensure consistency in feature formats.

**Models Explored**


1)Logistic Regression: Used as a baseline model for comparison.

2)Naive Bayes: Assumes feature independence and is simple and efficient.

3)Support Vector Machine (SVM): Effective in high-dimensional spaces, suitable for complex datasets.

4)K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN): A non-parametric method that handles multi-class problems well.

5)Decision Trees: Offers high interpretability and can handle both numerical and categorical data.

**Key Findings**


1)The project highlighted the importance of feature selection and the impact of data preprocessing on model performance.

2)Addressing data imbalances and refining feature engineering were crucial for improving the models.

3)ML models hold substantial promise for transforming credit scoring processes by providing more accurate, reliable, and equitable evaluations of creditworthiness.

4)Certain ML models, notably Decision Tree and SVM, significantly outperform traditional methods in predicting credit scores.
